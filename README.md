# SpeedRead ⚡

**SpeedRead** is a high-performance, functional speed reading web app that allows users to convert any book, article, or PDF into a fast-paced reading experience. It uses the **RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation)** method to display text one word at a time, locked to an **Optimal Recognition Point (ORP)** anchor.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Stationary Anchor Reading**: The red ORP letter stays perfectly still, allowing you to read without moving your eyes.
- **Smart Pacing**: Natural timing logic that adjusts for periods, commas, and long words.
- **PDF & Text Support**: Upload a PDF or paste text directly to start reading instantly.
- **Context View**: Toggle a side-view of the full text with active sentence highlighting.
- **Adjustable Speed**: Read anywhere from 100 to 800+ Words Per Minute (WPM).
- **Dark Mode First**: Premium aesthetic design tailored for focus.

## 🛠️ Built With
- **Vanilla JavaScript** (ES6+)
